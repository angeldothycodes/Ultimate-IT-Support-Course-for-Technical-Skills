# Business Internet Services

In today's digital age, having a reliable and fast internet connection is essential for both work and leisure.


### ISPs

<img width="752" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d6a96e-8267-41e4-86a9-dbeff7f5b96f" />


ISPs vary greatly depending on what type of plans they offer, their pricing, what speeds, whether

they're a home or a small business or an enterprise ISP. Some ISPs also may only serve certain regions or areas, whilst others have a nationwide coverage. It's important when choosing your internet service provider that you compare the different types of speeds, the different types of plans available to you if they have data allowances or if it's unlimited data, what type of offerings they give on top like static IPS and any sort of maybe DDoS security and things like that.

It's important that when you go to choose your ISP, you choose the one that's right for you.

It's important to do your research and compare different ISPs before choosing the one for your business.

Look out for reviews and customer feedback to get an idea of the quality of service they provide.

And remember, just because an ISP is the cheapest option doesn't necessarily mean it's the best option for your needs.


### VDSL

It's a type of broadband internet service that provides high speed data transmission over a copper telephone line.

VDSL is faster than the traditional aDSL, but the distance from the exchange is more critical with this type of service.

It's ideal for small businesses that require a fast internet connection, but are unable to access fibre optic broadband.


### COAXIAL

<img width="759" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1047f57e-35ac-4232-879e-49afb2d24317" />


Coaxial cable is a type of electrical cable that is used for transmitting broadband signals over long distances.

It's a popular choice for delivering high speed internet to households and businesses.

One of the main benefits is its high bandwidth capacity.

This makes it ideal for those that require fast and reliable internet connection.

Additionally, coaxial internet is relatively resistant to interference, which means you're less likely to experience disruptions in your connection.

It's available in most urban and suburban areas, and is a popular choice for internet service providers because of the high speed and low cost of installation.

It's important to note that coaxial requires specialized modems that terminate the coaxial cable and
then feed them into your edge device, which is usually a firewall. These are often provided by your ISP, so you don't need to worry about it.



### Fiber Optic

<img width="906" height="601" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428a1e5a-a175-4684-83f5-1022972266fc" />

Fiber or fiber optic broadband is a high speed internet service that delivers data using light pulses transmitted through fiber optic cables.

Fiber is much faster than your typical aDSL, DSL, VDSL, and coaxial internet service offerings and can offer speeds in the tens of gigabits.

Fibre is perfect for businesses that require high speed internet connection, particularly for large downloads or uploads.

Fibre terminations can be direct into your hardware, meaning you would have a firewall or router capable of connecting directly into the fibre.

But most often than not, the internet service provider will install some sort of network termination device in your premises that performs a conversion to Ethernet cable.


### Satellite

<img width="800" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f266a7b-b3d3-4119-a181-bbc8285846ea" />


Satellite internet is a wireless connection that is provided through a satellite dish installed on your

home or business.

Satellite internet is ideal for those businesses that are maybe in rural areas where there is no fixed line broadband available.

However, satellite is generally slower than other broadband connections.

It can be affected by weather conditions, and more often than not, there's quite a restrictive data cap on them.

So you may only be able to download a certain amount of data before the service stops working or stops working at the top speed.


### SD-WAN

<img width="763" height="435" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/611775f7-f475-4653-9578-68c78ccc4a59" />

SD-Wan, which stands for Software Defined Wide Area Network.

It's a technology that's transforming the way organisations manage their network infrastructure and is becoming quite popular.

SD-Wan allows organisations to use different types of network connections, so you may have one broadband internet and one LTE, so over four or 5G, and together they're able to create a flexible and secure wide area network.

It uses software defined networking to route traffic across the network based on your application requirements and maybe your network conditions.


# Internet Service Level Agreements

An SLA is a contract between the internet service provider and you as the customer, that defines the level of service that you should expect from that provider.


**WHAT IS AN SLA FOR INTERNET SERVICES?**

<img width="857" height="431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdac4a53-dd8d-41ad-b810-b85af7481657" />

An SLA is a formal agreement between you, the customer, and that internet service provider that outlines the terms and conditions of the service provided.

It defines things like the quality, reliability and availability of that service, as well as the level of support that is going to be provided to you by that internet service provider.


**IMPORTANCE OF SLAs FOR INTERNET SERVICES**

<img width="1196" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/476c7f9f-10bd-4edc-83b2-9c721ff68a6b" />


SLAs for internet services are important because they provide you with clear expectations of the service that you're paying for.

The SLA sets out the minimum standards of service that the provider must meet, and it outlines the consequences if they fail to meet these standards.

This helps to ensure that the provider delivers a reliable and high quality service.


**ELEMENTS OF AN SLA FOR INTERNET SERVICES**

<img width="1166" height="612" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3e9c139-bb9a-4123-a6ee-f33062f9dcb5" />


An SLA for internet services typically includes the following elements.

Firstly, a service description. This outlines the details of the service being provided.

Service performance outlines the performance metrics, such as bandwidth and latency, that the provider must meet.

Customer support defines the level of support the customer must provide to the customer, such as response times and issue resolution.

There may also be a service availability clause, which is the level of service and the level of uptime and downtime that you can experience with that internet service provider.


**BENEFITS OF SLAs FOR INTERNET SERVICES**

<img width="1181" height="624" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929b5a69-a22c-4710-8e5d-00935234f9c4" />

SLAs provide several benefits, including giving clear expectations that the customer understands what to expect from their provider.

There's accountability, so the SLA holds the provider accountable for delivering that reliable and high quality service.

SLAs provide customers with remedies. If the provider fails to meet the minimum standards of service, so this may be some money back on your service or a credit for next month's bill.

And there's room for continual improvement. So SLAs encourage providers to continually improve their service to make sure they're meeting the expectations outlined in this SLA.


### NOTES:

It's important to note that not all internet services will have an SLA. They are very much on the higher end of the scale for when you're looking at medium, large, or enterprise businesses, but I wanted to make sure that you at least understood what they are so that when you come across them, you have a better understanding of what it means.



# Backup/Secondary Internet Connections

<img width="925" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a027db-bb4e-45d3-89d7-ab9a7b6b64ba" />


 In today's connected world, Internet downtime can be costly for businesses. Having a backup internet connection is important because it ensures that you have internet access, even if your primary connection goes down.

This is particularly important for businesses that rely on internet for their operations, as downtime can lead to lost productivity, revenue, and customer satisfaction.


**Think of it in two different scenarios**

1. The first scenario is you're an organization that relies heavily on cloud applications. So SaaS applications. Internet downtime means that you're no longer able to reach these and neither are your employees. For every minute or for every hour that they're unable to access it, you need to determine what that revenue loss would look like.

And then think about would a secondary internet provider or this backup internet service be worth that investment?


2. The second example is something like a call center.
You absolutely cannot afford any internet downtime, because that means customers are unable to call in and their frustration with your organization may grow.


**=======================**

In these types of scenarios, it is absolutely critical to have even a second or even a third backup

internet connection, just in case the primary goes down. For true redundancy, you want to try and spread them out over different internet service providers, so that if there is a major outage in one of them and you've got two internet services with the same provider, both services aren't going to go down.

By having that layer of separation, where your primary internet connection is with one ISP and your
secondary internet connection is with a second ISP, you have a more chance of keeping your business operational in case of an incident.



**BENEFITS OF A BACKUP INTERNET CONNECTION**

<img width="1159" height="647" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c0b09bb-e0da-48f1-94c6-3e5ed2715195" />


Some benefits of having a backup internet connection include that business continuity.

It ensures that your business can continue to operate even if your primary internet connection goes down.

This could be because of a cut cable in a street, or potentially some maintenance that's going on in the provider's network, or even just an outage where something has gone wrong in their core network, causing all their customers to go offline.

Another option with the backup internet connection can be used to balance the load across multiple connections, improving the performance and reducing the risk of network congestion.


**OPTIONS FOR A BACKUP INTERNET CONNECTION**

<img width="862" height="502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b9f1a73-6540-418e-8149-31aaa64fe795" />


In our lecture on internet services, we already covered off many different types of internet services that are available, and any of them can be used as a backup internet.

So you may have a fiber primary and a VDSL backup, but there are several other options available for a backup internet connection that I want to talk about here.

1. Firstly is cellular backup. So I've seen this a lot in the smaller to medium business range, where they'll have a router capable of using a data SIM to connect out to that 4G or 5G network and use that as a backup internet connection.

Sometimes the problem with that is you don't get a lot of data allowance, so you do have to be careful.

However, like I say, in those small and medium ranges, this can be great so that if the internet provider has a couple of hour outage, your business is continually operating.

2. Satellite internet is another great option as it doesn't rely on any physical infrastructure in the ground, except for the dish on your roof.


<img width="678" height="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f26e6406-fc5d-4a0b-9663-00e2fa5f3fd8" />

So over on the right there, you've got your router and firewall.

For best practices when you're working in a large organization, you may have redundant firewalls just to make sure that there's no single point of failure.

In the more small to medium size, you're probably just going to have the one.

And then you can see that the two internet service provider services would terminate both onto that firewall. It's important that that firewall is capable of having the multi Wan or the failover type situation. Whether you're looking at having the failover or looking at having the load balancing, just make sure that it does support that sort of option.
