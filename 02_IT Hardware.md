# Business Internet Services

In today's digital age, having a reliable and fast internet connection is essential for both work and leisure.


### ISPs

ISPs vary greatly depending on what type of plans they offer, their pricing, what speeds, whether

they're a home or a small business or an enterprise ISP. Some ISPs also may only serve certain regions or areas, whilst others have a nationwide coverage. It's important when choosing your internet service provider that you compare the different types of speeds, the different types of plans available to you if they have data allowances or if it's unlimited data, what type of offerings they give on top like static IPS and any sort of maybe DDoS security and things like that.

It's important that when you go to choose your ISP, you choose the one that's right for you.

It's important to do your research and compare different ISPs before choosing the one for your business.

Look out for reviews and customer feedback to get an idea of the quality of service they provide.

And remember, just because an ISP is the cheapest option doesn't necessarily mean it's the best option for your needs.


### VDSL

It's a type of broadband internet service that provides high speed data transmission over a copper telephone line.

VDSL is faster than the traditional aDSL, but the distance from the exchange is more critical with this type of service.

It's ideal for small businesses that require a fast internet connection, but are unable to access fibre optic broadband.


### COAXIAL

Coaxial cable is a type of electrical cable that is used for transmitting broadband signals over long distances.

It's a popular choice for delivering high speed internet to households and businesses.

One of the main benefits is its high bandwidth capacity.

This makes it ideal for those that require fast and reliable internet connection.

Additionally, coaxial internet is relatively resistant to interference, which means you're less likely to experience disruptions in your connection.

It's available in most urban and suburban areas, and is a popular choice for internet service providers because of the high speed and low cost of installation.

It's important to note that coaxial requires specialized modems that terminate the coaxial cable and
then feed them into your edge device, which is usually a firewall. These are often provided by your ISP, so you don't need to worry about it.



### Fiber Optic

Fiber or fiber optic broadband is a high speed internet service that delivers data using light pulses transmitted through fiber optic cables.

Fiber is much faster than your typical aDSL, DSL, VDSL, and coaxial internet service offerings and can offer speeds in the tens of gigabits.

Fibre is perfect for businesses that require high speed internet connection, particularly for large downloads or uploads.

Fibre terminations can be direct into your hardware, meaning you would have a firewall or router capable of connecting directly into the fibre.

But most often than not, the internet service provider will install some sort of network termination device in your premises that performs a conversion to Ethernet cable.


### Satellite

Satellite internet is a wireless connection that is provided through a satellite dish installed on your

home or business.

Satellite internet is ideal for those businesses that are maybe in rural areas where there is no fixed line broadband available.

However, satellite is generally slower than other broadband connections.

It can be affected by weather conditions, and more often than not, there's quite a restrictive data cap on them.

So you may only be able to download a certain amount of data before the service stops working or stops working at the top speed.


### SD-WAN

SD-Wan, which stands for Software Defined Wide Area Network.

It's a technology that's transforming the way organisations manage their network infrastructure and is becoming quite popular.

SD-Wan allows organisations to use different types of network connections, so you may have one broadband internet and one LTE, so over four or 5G, and together they're able to create a flexible and secure wide area network.

It uses software defined networking to route traffic across the network based on your application requirements and maybe your network conditions.
