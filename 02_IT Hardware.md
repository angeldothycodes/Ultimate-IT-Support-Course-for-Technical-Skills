# Business Internet Services

In today's digital age, having a reliable and fast internet connection is essential for both work and leisure.


### ISPs

<img width="752" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d6a96e-8267-41e4-86a9-dbeff7f5b96f" />


ISPs vary greatly depending on what type of plans they offer, their pricing, what speeds, whether

they're a home or a small business or an enterprise ISP. Some ISPs also may only serve certain regions or areas, whilst others have a nationwide coverage. It's important when choosing your internet service provider that you compare the different types of speeds, the different types of plans available to you if they have data allowances or if it's unlimited data, what type of offerings they give on top like static IPS and any sort of maybe DDoS security and things like that.

It's important that when you go to choose your ISP, you choose the one that's right for you.

It's important to do your research and compare different ISPs before choosing the one for your business.

Look out for reviews and customer feedback to get an idea of the quality of service they provide.

And remember, just because an ISP is the cheapest option doesn't necessarily mean it's the best option for your needs.


### VDSL

<img width="661" height="480" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15a659b2-a158-4c5a-9ded-5cae4547c236" />


It's a type of broadband internet service that provides high speed data transmission over a copper telephone line.

VDSL is faster than the traditional aDSL, but the distance from the exchange is more critical with this type of service.

It's ideal for small businesses that require a fast internet connection, but are unable to access fibre optic broadband.


### COAXIAL

<img width="759" height="441" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1047f57e-35ac-4232-879e-49afb2d24317" />


Coaxial cable is a type of electrical cable that is used for transmitting broadband signals over long distances.

It's a popular choice for delivering high speed internet to households and businesses.

One of the main benefits is its high bandwidth capacity.

This makes it ideal for those that require fast and reliable internet connection.

Additionally, coaxial internet is relatively resistant to interference, which means you're less likely to experience disruptions in your connection.

It's available in most urban and suburban areas, and is a popular choice for internet service providers because of the high speed and low cost of installation.

It's important to note that coaxial requires specialized modems that terminate the coaxial cable and
then feed them into your edge device, which is usually a firewall. These are often provided by your ISP, so you don't need to worry about it.



### Fiber Optic

<img width="906" height="601" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/428a1e5a-a175-4684-83f5-1022972266fc" />

Fiber or fiber optic broadband is a high speed internet service that delivers data using light pulses transmitted through fiber optic cables.

Fiber is much faster than your typical aDSL, DSL, VDSL, and coaxial internet service offerings and can offer speeds in the tens of gigabits.

Fibre is perfect for businesses that require high speed internet connection, particularly for large downloads or uploads.

Fibre terminations can be direct into your hardware, meaning you would have a firewall or router capable of connecting directly into the fibre.

But most often than not, the internet service provider will install some sort of network termination device in your premises that performs a conversion to Ethernet cable.


### Satellite

<img width="800" height="444" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f266a7b-b3d3-4119-a181-bbc8285846ea" />


Satellite internet is a wireless connection that is provided through a satellite dish installed on your

home or business.

Satellite internet is ideal for those businesses that are maybe in rural areas where there is no fixed line broadband available.

However, satellite is generally slower than other broadband connections.

It can be affected by weather conditions, and more often than not, there's quite a restrictive data cap on them.

So you may only be able to download a certain amount of data before the service stops working or stops working at the top speed.


### SD-WAN

<img width="763" height="435" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/611775f7-f475-4653-9578-68c78ccc4a59" />

SD-Wan, which stands for Software Defined Wide Area Network.

It's a technology that's transforming the way organisations manage their network infrastructure and is becoming quite popular.

SD-Wan allows organisations to use different types of network connections, so you may have one broadband internet and one LTE, so over four or 5G, and together they're able to create a flexible and secure wide area network.

It uses software defined networking to route traffic across the network based on your application requirements and maybe your network conditions.


# Internet Service Level Agreements

An SLA is a contract between the internet service provider and you as the customer, that defines the level of service that you should expect from that provider.


**WHAT IS AN SLA FOR INTERNET SERVICES?**

<img width="857" height="431" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdac4a53-dd8d-41ad-b810-b85af7481657" />

An SLA is a formal agreement between you, the customer, and that internet service provider that outlines the terms and conditions of the service provided.

It defines things like the quality, reliability and availability of that service, as well as the level of support that is going to be provided to you by that internet service provider.


**IMPORTANCE OF SLAs FOR INTERNET SERVICES**

<img width="1196" height="643" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/476c7f9f-10bd-4edc-83b2-9c721ff68a6b" />


SLAs for internet services are important because they provide you with clear expectations of the service that you're paying for.

The SLA sets out the minimum standards of service that the provider must meet, and it outlines the consequences if they fail to meet these standards.

This helps to ensure that the provider delivers a reliable and high quality service.


**ELEMENTS OF AN SLA FOR INTERNET SERVICES**

<img width="1166" height="612" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3e9c139-bb9a-4123-a6ee-f33062f9dcb5" />


An SLA for internet services typically includes the following elements.

Firstly, a service description. This outlines the details of the service being provided.

Service performance outlines the performance metrics, such as bandwidth and latency, that the provider must meet.

Customer support defines the level of support the customer must provide to the customer, such as response times and issue resolution.

There may also be a service availability clause, which is the level of service and the level of uptime and downtime that you can experience with that internet service provider.


**BENEFITS OF SLAs FOR INTERNET SERVICES**

<img width="1181" height="624" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/929b5a69-a22c-4710-8e5d-00935234f9c4" />

SLAs provide several benefits, including giving clear expectations that the customer understands what to expect from their provider.

There's accountability, so the SLA holds the provider accountable for delivering that reliable and high quality service.

SLAs provide customers with remedies. If the provider fails to meet the minimum standards of service, so this may be some money back on your service or a credit for next month's bill.

And there's room for continual improvement. So SLAs encourage providers to continually improve their service to make sure they're meeting the expectations outlined in this SLA.


### NOTES:

It's important to note that not all internet services will have an SLA. They are very much on the higher end of the scale for when you're looking at medium, large, or enterprise businesses, but I wanted to make sure that you at least understood what they are so that when you come across them, you have a better understanding of what it means.



# Backup/Secondary Internet Connections

<img width="925" height="521" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29a027db-bb4e-45d3-89d7-ab9a7b6b64ba" />


 In today's connected world, Internet downtime can be costly for businesses. Having a backup internet connection is important because it ensures that you have internet access, even if your primary connection goes down.

This is particularly important for businesses that rely on internet for their operations, as downtime can lead to lost productivity, revenue, and customer satisfaction.


**Think of it in two different scenarios**

1. The first scenario is you're an organization that relies heavily on cloud applications. So SaaS applications. Internet downtime means that you're no longer able to reach these and neither are your employees. For every minute or for every hour that they're unable to access it, you need to determine what that revenue loss would look like.

And then think about would a secondary internet provider or this backup internet service be worth that investment?


2. The second example is something like a call center.
You absolutely cannot afford any internet downtime, because that means customers are unable to call in and their frustration with your organization may grow.


**=======================**

In these types of scenarios, it is absolutely critical to have even a second or even a third backup

internet connection, just in case the primary goes down. For true redundancy, you want to try and spread them out over different internet service providers, so that if there is a major outage in one of them and you've got two internet services with the same provider, both services aren't going to go down.

By having that layer of separation, where your primary internet connection is with one ISP and your
secondary internet connection is with a second ISP, you have a more chance of keeping your business operational in case of an incident.



**BENEFITS OF A BACKUP INTERNET CONNECTION**

<img width="1159" height="647" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c0b09bb-e0da-48f1-94c6-3e5ed2715195" />


Some benefits of having a backup internet connection include that business continuity.

It ensures that your business can continue to operate even if your primary internet connection goes down.

This could be because of a cut cable in a street, or potentially some maintenance that's going on in the provider's network, or even just an outage where something has gone wrong in their core network, causing all their customers to go offline.

Another option with the backup internet connection can be used to balance the load across multiple connections, improving the performance and reducing the risk of network congestion.


**OPTIONS FOR A BACKUP INTERNET CONNECTION**

<img width="862" height="502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b9f1a73-6540-418e-8149-31aaa64fe795" />


In our lecture on internet services, we already covered off many different types of internet services that are available, and any of them can be used as a backup internet.

So you may have a fiber primary and a VDSL backup, but there are several other options available for a backup internet connection that I want to talk about here.

1. Firstly is cellular backup. So I've seen this a lot in the smaller to medium business range, where they'll have a router capable of using a data SIM to connect out to that 4G or 5G network and use that as a backup internet connection.

Sometimes the problem with that is you don't get a lot of data allowance, so you do have to be careful.

However, like I say, in those small and medium ranges, this can be great so that if the internet provider has a couple of hour outage, your business is continually operating.

2. Satellite internet is another great option as it doesn't rely on any physical infrastructure in the ground, except for the dish on your roof.


<img width="678" height="371" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f26e6406-fc5d-4a0b-9663-00e2fa5f3fd8" />

So over on the right there, you've got your router and firewall.

For best practices when you're working in a large organization, you may have redundant firewalls just to make sure that there's no single point of failure.

In the more small to medium size, you're probably just going to have the one.

And then you can see that the two internet service provider services would terminate both onto that firewall. It's important that that firewall is capable of having the multi Wan or the failover type situation. Whether you're looking at having the failover or looking at having the load balancing, just make sure that it does support that sort of option.



# FIREWALL FUNDAMENTALS

<img width="1051" height="506" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ae4ddc-90aa-4c4e-91ca-c76fe4a51299" />


A network firewall is a security device that is designed to prevent unauthorized access to your network.

Think of it as a barrier between your network and the internet.

It's important not to confuse a network firewall with an application firewall that you might find on a windows PC or a server.

Application firewalls are designed to protect individual devices, whereas a network firewall is designed to protect your entire fleet of workstations, servers, and other network devices.


<img width="698" height="513" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ba20392-0e44-42f9-b6f2-8391325a80da" />

So how does a network firewall work?

Well, you would plug it into your internet and you would plug it into your LAN and it examines the incoming and outgoing network traffic and determines whether it should be allowed or blocked based on a set of rules you define.

These rules are based on a number of factors, such as the source of the traffic, the destination of the traffic, and the types of traffic.

An example here is if you wanted to block a certain country from accessing your data inbound, or if you wanted to block your employees from visiting certain websites, you would put these rules in the firewall to prevent that access that's restricted.


<img width="564" height="454" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/975f8757-d66a-432c-84cd-672719f0e765" />


<img width="880" height="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b8034d3-3d59-4286-90d7-2e7ce2824e16" />


<img width="886" height="479" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0609b13b-4a49-4258-a2e8-b2bf0f58dabf" />



Another huge advantage of these firewalls is the ability to offer virtual private networks, or VPNs for short.

There are two that I really want to cover off in this lecture, which is the site to site VPNs and the client to site VPNs.

Starting with the site to site VPNs, firewalls offer the capability to allow remote offices to securely connect together.

It enables secure communication between two or more office locations.



<img width="861" height="419" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/225d7e0e-e1c6-4037-a427-05f6f3f31c2b" />


A good example of this is the Hub and Spoke network.

That's where you have a head office.

Let's pretend in our scenario it's in New York and in this head office exists all your servers and main applications.

Your remote sites in Las Vegas, Houston and Washington need access to these, but you don't feel safe about opening these up to the internet and allowing them to connect through.

That's where a site to site VPN comes in handy.

You securely establish that site to site VPN between each of your remote offices and the head office, and it creates a tunnel for all of that data to funnel through, ensuring that it is encrypted, safe and easy to use for your employees.



<img width="901" height="467" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8b2ca9d-dcde-4bcb-8ca2-292514c30b7c" />

The other type of VPN I want to talk about is client to site VPN.

This allows individual users to securely access the network from a remote location.

In the modern world of remote working, where users can work from home or even overseas, a client to site VPN allows them to securely establish a tunnel from their workstation, whether that be a laptop, a PC, a tablet, or a mobile device, and securely VPN into the office's network, which makes sure that that data is encrypted as it goes back and forth. 
For added security, you can couple this with things like multi-factor authentication, ensuring that every time that user needs to connect into the VPN, they're entering their username and password as well as that multi-factor authentication.

You can also get certificate based client to site VPNs, which means that the individual machines have to have a certificate installed on them in order to authenticate. This protects your network from outside attack, where attackers may try and breach the VPN services in order to gain access to your network's infrastructure.


<img width="859" height="424" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e631b7-9c03-4c1f-82f3-f6d833c4963a" />



# Modem and Router Fundamentals

<img width="694" height="489" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5f0acc7-0778-4604-b407-c42e2b4c1bb6" />


A modem is a device that connects your computer or network to the internet through your internet service provider.

A router, on the other hand, is a device that connects multiple devices on a local network and routes data between them in the internet.

If you're confused because you only have one device at home that appears to do both.

This is because most modems double as routers these days.

How do modem routers work?

Well, the modem side of the device connects to your ISP's network and converts the data from your computer or your network into a format that can be transmitted over the internet.

A router on the other hand, does all the routing between the devices on your local network and connects that local network to the internet through the modem.


<img width="840" height="466" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/726669ca-1603-4ed5-b2ca-b8f3201ce521" />


Why, as a business, should you go with a firewall instead of a modem router?

Well, firewalls are specially designed security devices that are going to protect your network from advanced cyber threats.

A firewall provides more granular control over network traffic than a modem router.

Making it easy to configure advanced security policies and protocols.

Firewalls monitor the network traffic and block any unauthorized traffic outbound.

There's also a lot more support for things like VPNs within a firewall, which will allow you to set up those client and site to site VPN capabilities.

I've seen many businesses survive fine with a modem router in their organization.

However, as you start to grow and your attack vector becomes bigger, it's certainly worth at least thinking about.

Should you be moving to a network firewall solution instead?


# Switch Fundamentals

<img width="874" height="489" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4e18a2a-054c-4adc-a485-ed5f8be54ab5" />


A layer two switch operates at the data link layer of the OSI model, and forwards data based on the Mac address of different devices.

A layer three switch, on the other hand, operates at the network layer of the OSI model and forwards data based on the IP addresses.


<img width="883" height="459" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62ef6d82-785e-4a45-a3a7-e470e50ab191" />


Switches can also be unmanaged or managed.

A managed switch allows for much more control over the network as it allows you to go in and actually configure some of the more advanced features of a switch.

This includes things like VLANs, quality of service, many security features, all of which you can use to secure your business and better forward that traffic between the devices.

Unmanaged switches, on the other hand, are very much just a plug and play. With no configuration options at all. You simply plug it into power and that's it. Everything is on the same LAN, everything is on the same connection, and there are no security features or no additional options for you to configure.


<img width="850" height="412" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d15e8886-3e1c-46b7-89f3-c01eb8fba714" />


One really amazing thing with switches these days is they come with something called power over Ethernet capabilities.

This allows a switch to power devices such as IP cameras, wireless access points, or even VoIP phones over an Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for a separate power source for those devices.

Some VoIP phones also have a pass through feature, which means that you can connect them into the switch, and the phone will also connect to the PC so that each port on that switch is doing the data traffic for two devices, freeing up ports for the future.

It's important to note that when you're looking at a switch, not all switches are made the same.

Some only have half the ports that can do power. Some have all the ports, but there are sometimes restrictions on the maximum amount of wattage that a switch will be able to output.

So do your research when you're picking a switch, ensuring that it's going to cover you for now and the future of your business.


<img width="831" height="473" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ff0ae5e-fbb1-4c64-b6fc-a00a0cd324cf" />


There are also many different port speeds available with the switch, with one gigabit and ten gigabit being the most common one.

Gigabit switches are suitable for most small and medium sized businesses, while ten gigabit switches are more suited for that larger enterprise type business with higher bandwidth requirements.

Many switches these days have a mix with, say, 24 ports being on the one gigabit speed and potentially four ports being on the ten gigabit speed.

There are higher port speeds than ten gigabit or four switches.

However, these are most often used in enterprise and are quite expensive.

Not everything on a switch can also be fed via an Ethernet cable either.

You have a thing called an SFP module, which is simply a small modular transceiver that you can plug into certain types of switches that can then be connected to servers or other switches for faster speed.

These often traverse over a fiber optic cable, which will cover much later in this course.


**Here you can see the SFP modules that we covered, looking a little bit different to your standard Ethernet:**

<img width="853" height="427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/931d6e78-0194-47e0-933a-8b360d292096" />


<img width="901" height="434" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7577ffc7-b155-4ee1-aa99-3e0a386857af" />


Another really cool feature of switches is something called link aggregation.

It's a feature that allows multiple ports on a switch to be combined into a single logical link, increasing the bandwidth and redundancy.

This is useful in high traffic areas such as data centers or your server infrastructure, where a critical system needs to remain operational in case of a single link failure.

One of the most common places we see this is when connecting two switches together.

Because these are such critical components of your network infrastructure, a single point of failure is just not acceptable.

So by connecting a second or a fourth connection between the two switches, you can use link aggregation to not only provide extra bandwidth, but that extra redundancy as well.

<img width="868" height="487" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e13cbd7-b7ed-45bd-b762-b5f3c57fa97a" />


Stackable switches are a type of network switch that allow multiple switches to be interconnected and operate as a single logical switch.

This is achieved by using special ports on the switches known as stacking ports, which allow the switches to be physically and logically connected to each other.

Once they are stacked, they can be managed as a single unit with a single management interface.

This provides several benefits such as increased port density, improved resilience, and redundancy.

It's also simpler to manage.

There's less maintenance that needs to be done, and it's going to enhance the performance and scalability of your network.

These, again, are more commonly used in enterprise networks and data centers, where things like high availability, reliability and scalability are critical.


### Switch Loops

<img width="870" height="507" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc07e514-69a4-4684-8ea3-71f1d58a5c31" />

Something to be wary of in the IT industry is a switching loop.

A switching loop is a common problem that can occur when two or more switches are connected in a circular manner, causing network packets to loop indefinitely.

What happens is, as more and more loops occur, more and more resources on the switches are being used up.

This can quickly tumble into so many packets being involved in a loop that it's causing all of the switches resources to be consumed, meaning that legitimate traffic can't make it through.

To avoid switching loops, it's important to configure something called Spanning Tree Protocol.

This needs to be enabled on all switches in the network.

It works by disabling the redundant links in the network and preventing loops.

It is a very smart protocol so that if another link goes down, it can automatically open that one back up, ensuring that your interconnectivity continues to work.

I have seen networks completely crippled by switching loops, so it's important that when you're configuring your switches, you are accounting for this and making sure you're implementing the proper controls to make sure this doesn't happen.


### VLAN

<img width="891" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24637f5c-7c47-4129-9b74-ecb99709f392" />

Something of note, and something you're going to hear a lot of in the industry is a virtual local area network, otherwise known as Vlan.

This is a logical network created by partitioning a physical network into separate broadcast domains.

VLANs are super useful for segmenting network traffic, increasing network security, and providing better network performance.

You can couple this with security like access control lists, ensuring that certain VLANs are not allowed to talk to each other.

A good example of this is if you've got a CCTV network at and an IP security camera network that you don't want to be able to talk to your servers or your workstations.

Segment it into its own Vlan and restrict what traffic can make it through to others and what it can actually access.


### Security

<img width="575" height="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9504d6d2-a795-43fd-b299-721f7579c5f4" />


There are many things you can do to ensure that your switching environment is safe, but I wanted to just cover off a few now do not have direct inbound connection to the switches from the internet.

It may seem easy to just open up the Https or the SSH port into the switch, but by doing this you're essentially opening up tac vectors on these platforms.

So try to avoid this and have proper remote management tools in place for when you're needing to access these devices from another location.

It's very common for vendors of switches to release security patches in the firmware, so always ensure that you're applying these whenever any critical vulnerabilities are found.

Use strong passwords in order to access the switches management interfaces and where possible, lock it down using multi-factor authentication.

Always ensure that you're using a high security protocols like Https and SSH over insecure ones like HTTP and telnet.

Many switches come with something called a console port, which allows you to directly plug into the switch and access the management interface directly.

Ensure you're enabling this in places where the switch may be not physically secure, or to ensure that only certain people can access it in the case they need to.

There is much, much more you can do to ensure your switches and environment is safe, so I highly recommend always following the vendor Best Practices guides.


<img width="907" height="493" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06c90265-c3ca-4d0d-8266-165b73e6455a" />


# UPS Fundamentals (Uninteruptable Power Supply)



<img width="871" height="434" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80bc34bc-55c5-4762-9132-2f775f721363" />


A UPS is a device that provides backup power to critical equipment in the case of a power outage or

surge.

It typically consists of a battery that is charged by the AC power source, and an inverter that converts DC power from the battery to AC power for the connected equipment.


<img width="553" height="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d52662da-3c2a-4f56-a975-a8f562a368ce" />

UPS devices are essential for businesses that rely on critical equipment such as servers, switches,

and storage devices.

They provide uninterrupted power to these devices, preventing data loss, hardware damage, and downtime.

A sudden loss of power to a server can be absolutely damaging to some of the critical components inside

of it.

Data corruption can occur on the hard disks.

Memory modules can fail, and CPUs can overload.

That's why it's so important when you're implementing a network and server infrastructure to consider

the best ups for the job.


<img width="896" height="485" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1775780-cac4-4580-b6dc-7f881a6b9425" />


**UPS come in two main form factors.**

You can get rack mount and stand ups.

Rack mount UPS devices are designed to be mounted in standard server racks and are suitable for data

centers or server rooms.

A stand up.

UPS device, on the other hand, is something that can be floor mounted and are more suitable for small

to medium sized offices or even home offices.

It's important to note that UPS aren't always just for server and networking infrastructure only.

I've seen shops ensure they install them on their pod systems so that in the case of a power outage,

they can continue to operate and continue to take those Eftpos payments.


### How to Calculate Power and Output Runtime

<img width="889" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19ba2f72-8a93-4299-828d-35b7d9fa19d1" />


The power output of a UPS device is often measured in volt amps or watts.

To calculate the required power output and runtime of a UPS device, you need to add up the wattage

of all the equipment that will be connected to the UPS, and then factor in the desired runtime.

It's really important here to reach out to the vendors that are providing the UPS devices, as they

are often best equipped to assist you making these decisions.

Some things you need to take into consideration is do you want a UPS that can run your business for

a lot of time in case of these power outages?

Or do you just want enough time to be able to shut down everything safely in the situation that the

power does go down?

Wait for it to come back up and then automatically turn those devices back on.


<img width="421" height="228" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c09cbf2-e519-4644-a79b-6c77d0c06837" />

Many UPS devices come with a network card that allow for remote monitoring and management.

These cards can send alerts to administrators in the event of a power outage.

It can monitor the health of the UPS device and perform firmware updates.

Some UPS devices also come with network cards that allow for the automatic shutdown of connected servers in the event of a power outage.

This ensures the servers are being shut down gracefully, and data is saved before the UPS battery runs out of power.


### Security


<img width="833" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cea26768-d9ec-40fb-8e90-ba1cb11c2b5c" />

When we talk about the security of UPS devices of course they need to be physically secure.

So in a server rack that's potentially locked or in a locked room.

But it's also important to protect the management card and the software that runs the UPS devices.

Vices.

Always ensure your UPS devices do not have connectivity inbound from the internet and if possible,

prevent the outbound communication unless a firmware update is required to be downloaded.

Use strong passwords and two factor authentication where possible.

Always opt for using Https and SSH over unencrypted protocols like HTTP and telnet, and check the management

console frequently, being sure to set up remote monitoring and alerting to report any faults with the

device.

This can be things like the battery overheating, the battery starting to degrade, or when there's

a power outage.


### Conclusion

<img width="887" height="472" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29aac395-514c-43f2-9f13-9f2fccd331c6" />


# Network Attached Storage (NAS)

<img width="792" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee5d426f-ac28-4966-9a6a-f31f3780833b" />

And this device is a storage device, but much different to an external hard drive.

It's connected to your network and provides storage space that can be accessed by multiple devices at once.

In essence, it is a file server that allows users to store and share files over a network.

<img width="850" height="471" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eea46bc-4946-4297-9ddd-22cd9bf941c5" />


And this device typically consists of one or more hard drive devices, a network interface, and a software operating system that manages the storage and file sharing.

The device connects to the network using an Ethernet cable or perhaps fiber optic, and can be accessed by devices on the network using a variety of protocols such as SMB, NFS, and FTP.


<img width="865" height="482" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2799e1-0d23-44b0-a3ea-45da898b95c1" />

NAS device can offer several benefits for businesses, including centralized storage.

All files are stored in one location, making it easy to manage and backup the data.

There's data protection with Raid technology, which protects against data loss in the event of a hard drive failure.

One of the most common uses for NAS devices is it's a great target for your backups.

By using different backup software and targeting the destination as the NAS for your server and workstation backups, it'll allow you to have your backups on a different storage medium that you can securely lock down in case of a disaster.

Remember, a NAS device is still on your local network, so do not just rely on this for your backups.

You need to always ensure that you have an air gapped copy of your backup offsite so that if there is a flood or a fire, you're not losing all your workstations, all your servers, all your NAS devices, all at once.

And those are the only copies of your data that exist.


### Security

<img width="885" height="484" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a70ad39-e49a-41bc-9948-addb0e2fce61" />

have direct inbound

internet connection.

This means no forwarding ports through to the NAS device, as there are many vulnerabilities usually

floating around, that can allow hackers to gain access into your network device and potentially steal

your data.

Make sure you're using strong passwords and, where possible, two factor authentication.

This is especially important for any administrator users on that NAS device.

Make sure you're locking down the rights of Non-admin users.

This means that they shouldn't be able to potentially log in and make any changes to security permissions,

or the actual interface itself.

They should purely be using it as a file share only.

Please ensure that you're physically securing the devices as like external hard drives.

They are still extremely portable, so easy targets for thieves.

And the last one for this slide is download the latest security packages for the NAS.

Vendors are constantly releasing updates to patch these certain vulnerabilities, so it's important

that you're always downloading and installing these.


### Types of NAS Devices

<img width="846" height="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87ae5148-c500-41b9-998d-bfb1c6729bbc" />

There are several types of NAS devices available in the industry.

These include consumer grade, which are really designed for home users and typically have a limited

number of drive bays and features.

You can get business grade NAS devices, which are really targeted at more small to medium businesses.

These offer those more advanced features.

An enterprise grade NAS are designed specifically for large organizations and offer advanced features

such as scalability, high availability and even replication between two NAS devices.


### RAID


<img width="840" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d177ba2-c771-4616-af6d-788a154cb337" />

Raid is a technology that allows multiple hard drives to be used together to improve performance, data

redundancy and data recovery.

There are different types of Raid available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.


<img width="832" height="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1712ff54-5415-4cbd-862f-2d97446e660a" />


**RAID 0** = This type of Raid is designed for performance and uses data striping to split data across multiple drives.

So if you had four files that you were working on, it's possible that two would be saved on one hard

drive and two would be saved on the other hard drive. But to you, you only see one hard drive presented to yourself.

If there were two one terabyte hard drives located in that raid zero, that would mean you have two

terabytes of usable data.

However, there is a drawback.

There is no redundancy for Raid zero. If one of those hard drives was to fail, all of your data would be unaccessible.

If you are using Raid zero in any circumstances, it is imperative that you back up that data in case of a hard drive failure.

<img width="797" height="409" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5879468-6a0e-43a3-98cb-d5a49892e98f" />

***RAID 1** = A type of Raid designed for data redundancy, and uses mirroring to create an exact copy of data across two drives.

If you've got two one terabyte drives, your usable storage is only one terabyte.

But that data is mirrored.

So if one of those hard drives is to fail, you've always got another copy of your data. 

In a NAS device, it would simply just then involve taking out the faulty hard drive, putting a new working hard drive in, and it will replicate all that data back, ensuring that you continue to have that exact copy across two devices.

This rebuild does take some time, so it's important to monitor that and still have your backups both on premises and in the cloud in case of a disaster.


<img width="795" height="484" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5602f803-6d06-4222-b63d-53448388bca1" />


**RAID 5** = uses data striping with parity to provide both performance and data redundancy In our example

here, we have three hard drives, each at one terabyte.

Our usable capacity is only two terabytes because there is one terabyte of parity data.

This Raid type can support one disk failure.

So if any of these disks were to fail, we would continue to operate.

Restoration is much similar to the other Raid one where you would just take the faulty hard drive out,

put a new working one in, and it would rebuild the raid.


<img width="861" height="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81bc0c9b-e7d9-4387-ad8e-9add64ee4448" />


**RAID 6** = is that level up from RAID 5.

It again uses data striping with parity to provide that performance and data redundancy.

But in this case, you can support two disk failures.

Raid six has a minimum of four disks allowed in the configuration.

In this scenario, if each of those were one terabyte, you would only get two terabytes of usable space,

but you would have that double parity so that two disks can fail and you would still be operational.

Rebuilding the raid is the exact same.

If a disk failed, you would just take that one out, put a new one in, and allow the raid to rebuild.

As you build on a raid six, you still only need double parity.

So if we were to put another four drives in, that would mean we would have a total of six terabytes usable space with two terabytes being used for the parity.


### Conclusion

<img width="855" height="505" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a5adffe-b07e-43fd-9316-5cbedc198249" />


# Storage Attached Network (SAN)

<img width="574" height="408" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08cea260-9d92-45d4-be91-16bc69b5d661" />

**SAN** is a specialized network device that provides access to storage devices such as hard drives and solid state drives.

It allows multiple servers to access the same storage devices, which can be managed centrally.

Sans provide high speed access to data and are commonly used in enterprise environments.


<img width="811" height="472" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c11201c3-4aa0-43e7-9e37-a6676cb821e7" />

Imagine you've got two hypervisor servers.

Instead of storing the data on the hypervisor servers themselves, you could store the data of the virtual machines on the SAN.

This means that both servers can see them, and when acting in a cluster, can allow failover between the two in case of a disaster or if maintenance is required whilst you're eliminating the risk of the servers failing, you still have that single point of failure in the SAN itself.

Advanced SAN can come with replication features, which means that two sands with the same data can be present in your network, so that if one was to fail, you could simply use the second to access that data.

<img width="829" height="387" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c80134e0-049b-4beb-9294-d41cd6c25c1e" />

While both SAN and NAS devices provide centralized storage, there are significant differences between the two technologies.

NAS devices are file based and use standard network protocols, such as NFS or SMB to share files over a network.

SAN, on the other hand, are block based and provide access to a storage device at a lower level.


<img width="880" height="448" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95e5f5c7-d872-4657-b2ab-26388759e6bb" />


SAN provides several benefits over traditional storage solutions, including the high speed access to data.

SAN provide fast access to the data, which is critical in environments that require high performance storage.

This is usually done where, unlike a NAS, where you would connect it into a network switch and everything access it over there.

SAN are often directly plugged with high speed SSH from the server into the sand itself.

SAN allows storage devices to be managed centrally, which can simplify administration and improve efficiency.

SAN also provide capabilities such as Raid and Snapshotting to protect data from loss or corruption.

### Conclusion

<img width="526" height="390" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52bc1975-f0d2-442f-a506-40131f8c16b6" />



# External Hard Drives

<img width="857" height="522" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/361366ff-73ec-4cb8-a9c5-7549e49b7cf7" />


An external hard drive is a portable storage device that connects to a computer via a USB or some other interfaces.

It typically contains a hard disk drive inside of it, or perhaps a solid state drive, and provides additional storage space for files and data.

<img width="1063" height="596" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f96f1ab0-dd4b-425c-a81d-5840049a84ac" />


External hard drives are often used in a variety of ways in businesses, including backup and recovery.

External hard drives can be used to backup critical data and provide a way to recover data in case of a disaster or system failure.

It can be used to share files between computers or with clients.

They're extremely portable, meaning they can be used on the go and used to access data while traveling or in remote locations.

They can be used to expand the storage capacity of a computer, which can be especially useful in laptops and other type of mobile devices.


### SECURITY 

<img width="830" height="440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3ed2bfd-e1d6-4e7d-a2ca-f9dc15bbfe7d" />

The security of external hard drives is so important.

Always ensure that external hard drives are placed in secure locations as they are easily targetable

by thieves.

Even just taking your eye off of it for a second would leave plenty of time for a thief to walk on by, unplug it from your computer and run away.

One of its upsides being that it's so portable is also one of its downsides, in that it's so easy to

take.

I highly recommend looking at encrypting your external hard drive.

This means that every time it's plugged into a new device, you would need to enter some sort of password

in order to access the data on it.

Without that password, the data would be completely unreadable, meaning that your data was safe in

the case that it was stolen.

Another security tip is please never plug an unknown USB or external hard drive into your device.

Hackers will often leave a USB or external hard drives lying around with malicious payloads on them.

As soon as you plug them into your device, that's it.

They can obtain remote access.

They can steal your personal data.

So always ensure that the USBs and external hard drives you're using are from trusted sources only.



# Wireless Controllers

<img width="887" height="350" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/552114cf-8465-4178-b5e5-3958c5c717e7" />

<img width="897" height="348" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c6b39a8-2969-482d-bdb8-2463d33d4136" />

A wireless controller acts as a central hub, allowing access points to connect to it and provide configuration

and management options for those access points.

By managing multiple access points from a single controller, businesses can ensure that settings and

configurations are consistent across the network and can easily troubleshoot issues when they arise.


<img width="829" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13ef29cd-3d0e-4ac9-b93d-33f2ce79d628" />


Think of it like this.

Imagine you've got three floors in a building.

Each of these floors has one access point, and they're all connected to the same network.

Well, you can simply install a wireless controller that can control all three of those access points, meaning they have the same WiFi name, the same password, and the same security protocols.

This is great because some of the more advanced wireless controllers control which access points a device is connecting to.

So if you've got a user on the first floor that needs to travel up to the third floor, they don't need to reconnect to the wireless and they're not still connecting to the wireless access point down on the first level.

When they cross a crossover point, the wireless controller will automatically move them to connecting to the third access point on the third level.

This provides them with better performance, a more stable connection, and is a great way of managing those larger office spaces.

There are even situations if you have multiple offices throughout the state or the country.

If you're using the VPN technology that we spoke about before, you could potentially have one wireless controller at your central office controlling the wireless over several locations.


<img width="614" height="409" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1203cfc-55f4-42dc-8d11-8e943822592a" />


Wireless controllers can provide advanced features like load balancing, bandwidth management and access controls.

They can distribute wireless clients across multiple access points to ensure optimal performance, and can prioritize traffic to ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth.


<img width="893" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2db31460-bbbd-44f3-83ba-7a41c1699190" />


How do they manage access points?

Wireless controllers work with access points by providing them with the configuration and management information.

Access points communicate with the controller to receive instructions on settings like the channel selection, power levels, and security configurations.

The controller can also monitor the performance of each access point and adjust settings as needed to maintain optimal performance.

Controllers often have some sort of alerting and monitoring, which can allow it to tell you if there is potentially a problem with one of the wireless access points.

Overall, wireless controllers are a really powerful tool for managing large wireless networks.

They provide centralized control, advanced features, and easy scalability, making them an ideal solution for businesses of all sizes.



# WIRELESS ACCESS POINTS

<img width="1012" height="530" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4400410b-4281-4030-8081-472a2ee800d2" />


A wireless access Point is a networking device that allows wireless devices to connect to wired technology using Wi-Fi technology.

It acts as a central transmitter and receiver of wireless signals, enabling devices such as laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other network devices to access the internet or other network resources.

Whilst most routers have Wi-Fi inbuilt into them, a wireless access point is a separate network device. They are most often used when wireless coverage is important over a large area, such as a building with multiple floors or with a large office space.



<img width="1061" height="544" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abf8ef18-d69c-43b0-9849-c56a25b2c3ea" />


There are also different models for indoor and outdoor access points, due to outdoor models needing a bit more protection from the elements.


Wireless access points operate on two different frequencies 2.4GHz and five gigahertz. The 2.4GHz frequency has a much longer range, making it suitable for covering larger areas, but it's

more susceptible to interference from other devices.

The five gigahertz frequency has a shorter range, but offers much faster speeds and is less prone to the interference.


<img width="992" height="488" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23b02ca0-df35-4890-91cf-eb3fe7f54825" />


Wireless access points can operate on different channels, and it's important to avoid channel interference, which can cause signal degradation and slow down the network.

Selecting the right channel and adjusting power settings can help minimize interference and improve performance.

Fortunately, most wireless access points these days have some sort of channel interference detection, which can automatically move the channels if it detects something in your area, could be interfering with the wireless.



<img width="922" height="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41e79d78-c77d-4498-a088-52bb21aa10c1" />


SSID Broadcasting is the process of making the network name visible to users, allowing them to connect to the network.

We've probably all been to cafes and fast food restaurants that provide free WiFi, so the Ssid is simply that network name that you connect to.

You can hide the SSD, which can provide some security benefits, but it can also make it more difficult for users to connect to the network and may not be effective against more determined attackers.

That's because applications exist that can sniff out the different types of ssids broadcasting in an area.



<img width="906" height="438" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05ebd3c0-61e6-4fe9-a0b2-2116b52845d7" />

There are different types of security when it comes to how you connect to the wireless.

**WPA** was developed as a replacement for a very old protocol called WEP, and it provides much better security.

**WPA2** is the most commonly used protection protocol, and it allows you to enter a password in order to connect to that wireless network.

**WPA3** is the latest version of Wi-Fi Protected Access Protocol. It provides more advanced security features than Wpa2, such as enhanced encryption and improved password protection.

**EAP** is a framework for authentication that supports multiple methods, not just a password. You can use digital certificates and smart cards to connect your users devices into your wireless network. These are much more difficult to obtain than a password, so it's worth considering if this is right for you.

**802.1X** is a protocol that provides a framework for port based network access control. It's often used in conjunction with EAP for authentication, and can allow users to use their local credentials or the credentials that they access their workstation with to connect to that Wi-Fi device.


# SERVER HARDWARE


<img width="1070" height="481" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/464225ec-bfa6-4788-a7e3-351f863e23fe" />

The hardware components that go into a server can vary depending on the intended use and the requirements of the specific applications or roles that you're running.

However, let's just cover off some of the most common hardware components found inside a server.

<img width="1145" height="596" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fb708e9-cf57-4610-a435-a87ff2c35a06" />



**NIC** 

Workstations will often just have one network interface, whereas servers will have many. It's not uncommon to see four network interfaces bound using link aggregation and connected into a switch. It's also important to note that not many servers out there use wireless. Having that wired connection is so much more reliable and needed for server infrastructure.


<img width="991" height="533" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af7294f4-98e7-44ff-b6c9-114fe04179d8" />

There are many third party applications as well that you can store on Windows Server for things like finance, marketing, medical software, and just so many different tools available to each industry.

It's important to consider when you're running up an environment. If these applications should be installed on a server, and what are the recommended specs in order to run it.

In addition to these common server roles, Linux servers can be configured to perform a wide variety of other tasks such as hosting game servers, serving media content, and providing remote access.

One of the key advantages of Linux servers is their security. Linux servers are less susceptible to viruses, malware, and other security threats, making them an ideal choice for organizations that require high levels of security.

This, of course, is only true if you continuously work to improve the security of your organization.

Don't expect just to install a Linux server and it stays safe forever.

Another advantage of Linux servers is the reliability.

Linux servers are known for their stability and can be run without needing to be rebooted constantly.

This makes them an ideal choice for mission critical applications that require high levels of uptime and availability.

Linux also uses a lot less resources than your graphical interface operating systems like Windows and Mac OS.

There are devices that can run Linux that fit into the palm of your hand.

Linux has many different distributions or distros for short, which are variations of the operating system that are customized for specific application or user needs.


<img width="696" height="539" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15f9064c-94eb-4b75-9a15-364b62263c4d" />

Linux has many different distributions or distros for short, which are variations of the operating system that are customized for specific application or user needs.

Some popular ones that you'll probably hear around the industry is Red hat, Ubuntu Server, CentOS, and Debian.

But there are so, so many more.

This is because of that open source software, which allows many people to come together and build the operating system that they want or need.

# NETWORK CABINETS AND SERVER RACKS

<img width="1124" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb33b828-77e9-49dc-a0b6-5ab0aa9f2f6e" />

Another factor to consider is the cooling and ventilation of the network cabinet or rack.

Some server racks have built in fans or ventilation systems to help keep equipment cool and prevent overheating.

For server racks, it's not uncommon to have some sort of system where cool air is pumped through the front and warm air is extracted through the back.

The way the fans are pointing within the servers themselves allow this to happen.

It's important that you do not have security cameras publicly exposed to the internet inbound, as there are several ways that hackers can use to breach these devices and then monitor your video surveillance.

If you need remote access, look at methods that doesn't involve this, like having some sort of app or SaaS based security camera application where the cameras connect outbound through your firewall back to this central point.



# ETHERNET CABLES

<img width="1080" height="619" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7c030ad-c80e-4de2-9cf7-3635e761853e" />


Category six can transmit up to ten gigabit a second at around 30 to 55m.

Past that you are going to see some degradation of service, and this is potentially where you want to start looking at fiber optic cables.

Category six is an improved version over Cat six, and it can transmit data over speeds up to ten gigabit, but these still only work up to about 100m past that. Again, fiber optic is your thing.


The types of Ethernet cables you choose will depend on the network requirements, distance, and the speed needed.

Each type of Ethernet cable has different specifications such as bandwidth, frequency, and distance.

For example, Cat5 and Cat5 cables that we spoke about have a bandwidth of about 100MHz, while Cat6 and 6a have about 250 and 500, respectively.

The frequency of the cables affects the amount of data that can be transmitted with higher frequencies, allowing for greater data transfer rates.


Ethernet cables are used in a wide range of applications, from home networks to large scale enterprise networks.

Ethernet cables can be used to connect devices within a single room, within a building, or even across multiple buildings, if they are in close vicinity.

# FIBER CABLING


<img width="688" height="502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50d1e108-0066-4164-9533-ddb45286f7e8" />


<img width="867" height="467" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16496beb-4af4-473b-aed5-d43190f06b56" />


<img width="603" height="420" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bb22874-5a6a-456a-bbeb-379ff1e105b0" />


Another advantage of fibre cabling is its immunity to lightning strikes and electrical surges, making it a safer option for use in areas with volatile weather conditions.

It is also thinner and more flexible than a traditional copper cable or Ethernet cable, making it easier to install and requiring less space.



<img width="829" height="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdc1ba14-ce73-4306-8adf-33b44b632933" />

One example of where it could be used, for example, is if you've got a switch where there are ten PCs connected over one Gigabit Ethernet cables.

Instead of having to connect to the server using a one gigabit cable, you could use one of the SFP modules and install a ten gigabit fiber cable so that the communication between the switch and the server is ten gigabit.

<img width="558" height="363" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10c1d973-a4d2-4c30-a8b6-94d7c3e46334" />



# PATCH PANELS


<img width="1049" height="324" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a2c1610-e1ba-40ae-8d46-3b6dfbe242e2" />


<img width="1181" height="630" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98ec5251-e831-482d-aac9-57c924a2400f" />


Patch panels come in various sizes and configurations, but the most common ones are 24 port or 48 port panels.

These panels are typically mounted in a network rack or cabinet, which is usually located in a dedicated room or closet in the office.


<img width="880" height="468" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d176cc97-b667-41c7-b1d0-279b086c474d" />


Why are patch panels so important?

Well, one of the main reasons is that they can make it easy to manage network connections.

By centralizing all the cables in one location, it becomes easier to identify and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.

Another reason is that patch panels make it easier to add or remove devices to the network.

Instead of having to rerun cables or install new ones, you can simply connect or disconnect a device to the patch panel using a patch cable, otherwise known as an Ethernet cable.


## How do they work?

<img width="1208" height="587" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd58e9b3-b996-4170-876d-65e364371bf6" />

Well, patch panels have ports on the front and back, with each port corresponding to a network cable.

The front ports are used to connect patch cables, which are short cables with connectors on both ends.

These cables are used to connect devices like computers, printers, and switches to the patch panel.

The back ports are used to connect the network cables that run throughout the office.


These cables are usually run from wall jacks in various locations throughout the office, and terminate at the patch panel.

The cables are then connected to the back of the patch panel using a punch down tool, which secure the cables in place and makes that reliable connection.

There are many cable management devices out there that you can install inside your network cabinet or network rack in order to keep that patch panel looking clean.

# VoIP

<img width="725" height="490" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa7f909a-cbf3-4ef6-8948-f61f150c1e41" />

If your business is one that receives and makes a lot of phone calls, I would definitely recommend looking at a VoIP system.

Another benefit of VoIP is the flexibility.

Since VoIP systems operate over the internet, employees can take their phones with them wherever they go.

This means that employees can work from home, on the road, or anywhere with an internet connection, by either bringing their phones with them or downloading apps onto their mobile devices. They can bring the business with them wherever they go.

# FAXES


<img width="760" height="475" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78167038-d4c2-4f36-bcb5-6946fb6f9ba7" />

Fax is short for facsimile.

Machines are devices that transmit paper documents over a telephone line.

The sender places the document on the fax machine, dials the recipient fax number, and presses send.

<img width="1099" height="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd21f779-f8b3-4c67-93c7-be32cd126aa6" />


Thirdly, faxes are just not secure.

They can be intercepted by third parties, or even just someone picking up a piece of paper from the fax machine when they weren't meant to.

This can potentially compromise sensitive information, which is why you should be looking at more modern solutions for communication.

# PRINTERS


<img width="1053" height="555" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95e8ce12-595a-48c6-82ca-f6095ade6377" />


Firstly, I want to talk about the type of printers.

There are two main types of printers that I want to talk about, and they're the most common ones you're

going to see in the industry.

Inkjet printers are great for printing high quality color images, but they can be expensive to maintain.

Laser printers, on the other hand, are ideal for high volume printing and are often found in offices

due to their speed and reliability.


<img width="559" height="529" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5951455f-2d1d-4627-a18b-2234afad9403" />


The majority of printers these days are multifunctional.

This means that they can do things like print, scan, copy, and fax documents.

This versatility can be a great asset to an office environment, but it's important to ensure that these features are properly set up and configured for your needs.


<img width="1073" height="499" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6034a1d-ed6a-435e-b072-18ed1cdda1bc" />



Windows Print Server is probably one of the most commonly used ways of deploying printers.

There are many other ways, including some third party tools which can tie into a printer and allow for features like pay-per-print, or scan to print these days.

There are even cloud management platforms that centralize the management of all your office printers.


A print server, though, is commonly used because you simply add the printer, add the driver onto the print server, and you can deploy that to all machines in your organization. Or if the need arises, you can restrict which people have access to that printer.


<img width="778" height="532" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b7a8b7d-8ca5-40a1-a370-4a04b8412d1d" />

Ask any IT professional, and they'll tell you that printers can be one of the most troublesome devices in the network.

Printers can suffer from paper jams, connectivity problems, and driver issues, and these are all common problems that as an IT professional, you're going to encounter.

It's important to have a solid understanding of how the printer functions and the causes of these issues in order to properly troubleshoot and resolve them.


Connectivity problems can often be due to wireless, so where possible, you always want to try and use a wired connection for printers and driver issues sometimes can be fixed as easily as going to the manufacturer's website and downloading the latest driver for that printer.
