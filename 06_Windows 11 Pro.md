Home is designed for consumers.

It's the consumer focused edition.

It has a beautiful interface and strong security by default.

But it's limited from an administrative perspective.

It lacks tools like group policy editor or even the ability to be able to join it to a local or cloud domain, which means that you have limited remote and management features, as well as no real way to deploy policies onto it, such as, let's say, for say, for example, we're a system admin and we want to block users from downloading and running certain files.

Well, we just can't do that with the Home Edition. It's focused for people who have their PCs and laptops at home that have nothing to do with business environments.

If we are looking at business environments, that's where Windows 11 Pro steps in.

So this is what most IT professionals and small businesses use.

It offers administrative tools like BitLocker, Hyper-V, and the Group Policy Editor, and it can also be joined to a domain or Azure AD now known as Entryid, making it a solid choice for system admins.

# What is Entra ID?


Microsoft Enter ID is a cloud based identity and access management service. You'll sometimes hear this abbreviated to IAM. Think of it as the cloud version of Active Directory, but with a little bit of a twist.

Unlike traditional AD, which typically is hosted on a local server, entra ID lives entirely in the cloud and is designed for organizations using Microsoft 365, Microsoft Intune, and other modern SaaS applications software as a service.

It's what allows users to sign into Microsoft 365 teams, OneDrive, and other services, all with a single identity from any device anywhere in the world.

At its core, entra ID can handle single sign on, multi-factor authentication, conditional access policies, device management, and much, much more.

It's a critical part to Microsoft's zero trust security model, where identity becomes the main control point rather than just the network perimeter.

Now, when it comes to Windows 11, you can join a machine directly to entra ID instead of joining it

to a traditional domain.

So if you don't have any on premises hardware, for example, but you do have Microsoft 365 licensing.

That's where entra ID, previously known as Azure AD join, comes in.

It's really ideal for those cloud first organizations, businesses that don't have on prem servers, or even hybrid teams who need to log into corporate devices from anywhere.

Once Windows 11 device is joined to entra ID, you can apply policies via Intune just like you would

as on premise what you would do via group policy.

And you can enforce compliance rules as well.

It's also the backbone of something called Microsoft Autopilot, which is for automated deployments of machines.
