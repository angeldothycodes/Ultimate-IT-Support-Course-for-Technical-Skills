Home is designed for consumers.

It's the consumer focused edition.

It has a beautiful interface and strong security by default.

But it's limited from an administrative perspective.

It lacks tools like group policy editor or even the ability to be able to join it to a local or cloud domain, which means that you have limited remote and management features, as well as no real way to deploy policies onto it, such as, let's say, for say, for example, we're a system admin and we want to block users from downloading and running certain files.

Well, we just can't do that with the Home Edition. It's focused for people who have their PCs and laptops at home that have nothing to do with business environments.

If we are looking at business environments, that's where Windows 11 Pro steps in.

So this is what most IT professionals and small businesses use.

It offers administrative tools like BitLocker, Hyper-V, and the Group Policy Editor, and it can also be joined to a domain or Azure AD now known as Entryid, making it a solid choice for system admins.
