It's responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and directing tasks between

the different hardware components.

Essentially, the CPU handles everything that keeps your computer running from opening applications

to complex data processing.

They're often measured by their clock speed, which is measured in something called gigahertz, and

the number of cores which determine how many tasks they can handle simultaneously.


When choosing a CPU, one of the biggest decisions is between two companies, and that's Intel and AMD,

who are definitely at the forefront of innovation when it comes to CPU technology.

Intel is typically known for higher clock speeds and strong single core performance, which makes it

ideal for gaming and applications that rely on fast processing per core.

However, AMD have made a massive dent in the market recently because these days they often offer more

cores and threads at a lower price, which makes it perfect for multitasking and productivity tasks

like video editing or rendering, but are also making huge splashes in the gaming industry as well.

Understanding this difference is going to help you select the best CPU for your needs.

Now there is some software that is optimized for Intel, while others take advantage of AMD's core count.


When you're thinking about these brands, specifically the motherboard, the motherboard is only

going to be capable of either handling Intel or AMD.

So you've always got to remember that you cannot cross use these.

You cannot buy a motherboard that was built for AMD and use an Intel chip within it.

Choosing the right CPU depends on your needs.

For gaming, you are going to want to prioritize higher clock speeds and multiple cores. 
For content, creation or professional work more cores and threads can improve your performance.


The CPU is a really critical component because it influences the speed and responsiveness of your entire system.

It's essential for multitasking and performing heavy applications like video editing or gaming.

A strong CPU ensures compatibility with modern software and hardware, making it a key factor in your build.

So, in conclusion, the CPU is the driving force behind your computer's performance.

Choosing the right one can significantly impact your experience from faster load times to smoother multitasking.


# RAM (Temporary Memory and Speed Booster)

<img width="898" height="539" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e208ac79-fe5e-44c1-a2ed-a9e65d093d62" />


Ram or random access memory is like your computer's short term memory.

It temporarily holds data that your system is actively using, allowing for quick access and efficient

multitasking.

The more Ram you have, the more tasks your computer can handle simultaneously.

However, Ram is volatile, and the meaning of that word is that the data is lost when the computer is turned off.

It's measured in gigabytes for capacity and megahertz for speed.

Now, when you open an application, the necessary data is loaded into Ram from your hard drive or SSD.

And we'll be talking a lot more about those in upcoming lectures.


This allows the CPU to access the data much faster than if it had to pull it directly from storage each time.

Ram essentially acts as a bridge between the CPU and storage, boosting performance and responsiveness.

When you close a program or restart the computer, the data in Ram is erased, freeing up space for new tasks.

And this is why it doesn't need as much space as your hard drive or SSD, because it's constantly refreshing through different data.


<img width="992" height="514" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c493ce5e-0bdf-448b-8dbf-f0cb5ea582dd" />


Sodium is a smaller form factor used in laptops.

ECC Ram is error correcting and is typically used in servers and workstations where data integrity is crucial and Vram is a specialized type of Ram used in graphic cards to handle visual data.

Now, one thing to take into consideration is a motherboard is going to be one of these compatible.

It's either going to be DDR3, DDR4 or DDR5.

You cannot get a piece of DDR5 RAM and put it in a DDR3 motherboard.


Now, Ram plays a vital role in system performance.

With sufficient Ram, your computer can handle multiple applications simultaneously without slowing down.

This is especially important for tasks like gaming, video editing, and design, which require large amounts of data to be processed quickly. Insufficient Ram can lead to system slowdowns, crashes, and poor performance.


The amount of Ram that you need depends on what you plan to do with your computer.

Typically, eight gigabytes is enough for basic tasks like web browsing and office work, but for gaming and multitasking, you can go anywhere from 16GB all the way up to about 64GB.

If your video editing, 3D rendering, or using professional applications, you may need even more than 64GB in a workstation.


It's always a good idea to future proof your system by choosing higher capacity Ram if your budget allows it.

If you're a gamer, Ram is absolutely critical.

Gaming requires large amounts of data to load quickly and higher.

Ram allows for smoother gameplay, reduce load times, and minimal stuttering.


<img width="1023" height="511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/921c149a-9549-44a9-b8fa-8e2233cfb726" />


Fortunately, upgrading Ram is one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to boost your computer's performance.

Before upgrading, check your Motherboard's compatibility to ensure it supports Ddr3, Ddr4, or Ddr5 RAM.

It's important to match Ram speed and capacity for the best performance.

Installing Ram in pairs enables something called dual channel mode, which improves data transfers, so if the motherboard supports it, always look out for this and ensure that you're having both sticks present.

Ram is a crucial component that directly impacts your computer's speed and multitasking abilities.

So whether you're gaming or editing videos or simply browsing the web, having the right amount of Ram ensures smooth performance.

Make sure to choose Ram that fits your system needs, and consider future upgrades to keep your computer running efficiently.



# STORAGE (HDD vs SSD - WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?)


<img width="783" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/724e2b6d-a630-4c5a-b094-c926658f554b" />


Storage devices are the components in your PC that hold data, which allows you to save files, install

software, and run your operating system.

Without storage, your computer wouldn't be able to retain information after being powered off.

Now, there are two types of primary storage that I want to talk about in this lecture.

And that's hard disk drives or HDDs for short.

And the other one is solid state drive or SSDs. 

Each have their own strengths and weaknesses.

<img width="851" height="447" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/399e1b31-8008-4ff9-9da8-ab29f320880d" />


**HDD**. These are your traditional spinning disk technologies. They've been around for a very very long time. They are high storage capacity at a lower cost.

Now, these days, hard drives are very capable of. Even in one hard drive alone, storing something like 10 to 20TB. And each year as the technology improves, that storage ability gets bigger.

But there is a trade off.

Hard drives are a lot slower at reading and writing data than solid state drives.

So typically hard disk drives are saved for things like bulk storage.

So imagine you're storing a whole bunch of movies, backups, large files.

Those are perfect for hard disk drives.

However, if you're running applications, performing video games, or doing something like editing engineering structures or using ArchiCAD, Autodesk, anything like that.

Hard disk drives are just going to slow everything down.

If you were to run a game on a hard drive, loading a map in comparison to an SSD is going to take about ten times longer.

So if you're moving from level to level, you are definitely going to notice the slower speeds because you've got a hard disk drive.

Now they still have their place in the industry. For example.

They want to create backups of their PCs.

Well, you don't want to back it up to SSD because that's going to be very cost ineffective.

So you purchase a few hard disk drives and you can back up the data inside that.


<img width="771" height="417" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d17d02c-0af6-4096-a4e8-779457720486" />

Unlike a hard disk which has those spinning disks within a solid state.

Drive is just flash memory, so there's no moving parts.

They have much faster read write speeds than hard drives.

They're more durable and energy efficient, and they're best for things like running operating systems, your applications, and your games. They're perfect for tasks that demand speed.


<img width="919" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32809a83-c11d-4475-9667-67b2db187e79" />

So hard drives are slower and less durable, but offer more storage for the price.

SSDs are faster and more reliable, but come at a higher cost per gigabyte.

So depending on your needs, you might choose a hard drive for mass storage, or you might choose an SSD. Or maybe you could have both.

Remember that most motherboards are going to have several SATA ports, so you could have your operating system on an SSD, have a second SSD for your video games and everything, and then a third disk in there, which would be a hard drive. And that could be for your large files and your backups.


## ADDITIONAL STORAGE SOLUTIONS


In addition to hard drives and SSDs, there are two other storage solutions I want to talk about.

1. The first one is NVMe drives, and these are even faster than SSDs.

And what they do is they connect directly to the motherboard.

These drives typically again come with less storage but higher speeds.

So if you are looking for something to run your operating system and your motherboard supports NVMe, that's going to be your best bet.


2. The other one I wanted to talk about is external hard drives.

Now these provide portable storage, which are great for things like backups or moving files to and from different machines.

It's always important, though, when using external hard drives or external hard drives, to consider the risk that they're easy to steal because they are so portable.

So if you are worried about that, it's always worth looking at things like encrypting the hard drive with a password or some sort of BitLocker key to ensure that even if it was stolen, these malicious actors couldn't get access to your data.


3. Something else to take into consideration is there is something called a hybrid drive, which is a combination of SSDs and hard drives. These are probably more rare than both of the two.



<img width="999" height="471" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/727cc30d-b1de-4f05-94cc-56b6e8a5e400" />

So choosing the right storage really depends on your needs.

If speed is crucial, you have to go for an SSD, and these days you can get SSDs probably up to around 2 to 4TB.

Now that is going to cost a lot more than a 2 to 4 terabyte hard drive.

But if you need speed and storage, you may be able to find some middle ground there.

But if you are using large amounts of data, a hard drive is much more cost effective.

Many PC builds do combine both, so an SSD for fast performance and a hard drive for additional capacity.

So remember to assess you or your clients requirements and budget to strike the perfect balance.

Storage devices are a vital part of the PC which directly impacts performance and data management.


# GPU (Graphics and Why it Matters)


<img width="1063" height="457" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c08ed4d3-21b3-4bce-bbfe-418fee71e692" />


The GPU is essential for rendering visuals on your computer, whether it's games, videos, or 3D models.

The GPU handles all graphical tasks, offloading the work from the CPU, which is really critical when you think about it.

This boosts the performance and ensures smooth visual experiences.

GPUs are indispensable if you're the type of person who's using a PC for things like gaming, video editing, and professional creative work.


<img width="1057" height="557" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c2c6ba6-a9f1-4a89-ad4f-d4154a2335d1" />

Integrated GPUs are part of the CPU and handle basic tasks like web browsing or video streaming.

When it comes to dedicated GPUs, on the other hand, these are separate components that deliver high performance for demanding applications.

Now, you may also hear of things called E-GPUs or external GPUs.

These can be connected to laptops to enhance their graphical power.


<img width="1095" height="574" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35a194ea-4a22-434b-8629-00043481bb6b" />


When selecting a GPU, it's important to understand the key specifications.

**Vram or video Ram** determines how much graphical data can be stored and processed at once.

**Higher clock speeds** indicate faster performance, whilst **Cuda cores**, Nvidia or Stream processors for AMD, which we'll talk about in a moment, reflect processing power.

**Ray tracing** is also something that a lot of people expect from a GPU, and it's a newer feature which enhances lighting and shadows for more realistic video visuals, especially in video games.


<img width="1090" height="562" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/227b54b5-968b-4bba-bd82-03a01fd1be9d" />


However, as an industry and as a kind of third party separate from both of these companies, I will say more people are definitely going towards the Nvidia route.

If you are choosing between the two, consider things like driver stability, software support and the specific performance requirements of your tasks.


<img width="987" height="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/398492ce-fe08-4c1f-b708-d8c406a9b93f" />


# POWER SUPPLY

<img width="1040" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9feb21-6a19-4107-ac56-92e9dcaf1e34" />


A **power supply unit, often shortened to PSU** converts AC power, which comes from your wall to DC

power, which is going to power the components within the PC itself.
It's going to supply power to all parts of the computer.

So that's all your drives the motherboard, the CPU, the graphics card, everything that requires power, which when you think about it, is pretty much everything.

Even plugging a simple USB or external hard drive in is going to require power.

And that all comes from these power supply units.

They have a job to regulate and distribute the correct voltage, ensuring that not too little gets supplied, which is going to essentially make the components either not work at all or work very slowly, but also that not too much power is applied which could fry different parts of your machine.

For example, if you were to put too much power into a motherboard, it's not uncommon for a capacitor to blow, which can cause permanent damage towards the unit.

The PSU is measured in watts, which is going to indicate how much power it can supply to the entire system.

So when you're looking at power supplies, they're going to have ratings and different watts.

And the watts is something you need to take into consideration, especially for higher end PCs.

You're going to need to always ensure that the power supply has enough power to produce all the units running operationally.


<img width="1003" height="297" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4914817d-3ae2-45d2-b9f2-30e88cd0574b" />


When choosing a PSU, there are several key specifications to consider.

So we already spoke about wattage and this tells us how much total power the PSU can provide.

There's also efficiency ratings such as 80 plus, bronze, silver and gold and higher.

And this is to indicate how efficiently the power supply converts power with minimal wastage.

Modularity refers to the ability to detach cables, improving airflow and cable management within your PC's. And finally, PSU is also differ in how they distribute power.

Single rail or multi rail which can affect load balancing and safety.
