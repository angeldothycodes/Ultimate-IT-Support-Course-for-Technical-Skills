>> Computers are usually managed centrally using a system called Active Directory, and when you join a machine to the domain, it can be centrally managed by it.


>> Users can log in with their domain credentials.


>> Group policies can be applied to control settings and security, and it also helps with device tracking, updates, and access control.



>> It can also help the user do things like connect to local shares that are set up on file servers, and sign in using their single sign on to various applications.


**As a helpdesk technician, you may be asked to do this when setting up a new device or when joining a machine that was removed from the domain.**


**Troubleshooting:**
1. Make sure you have the domain name

2. The computer needs to be connected to the corporate network. Somewhere where it can talk to the AD server
